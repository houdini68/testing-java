# Testing Java,Guava,...

By Rudy Vissers from Belgium. English is not my mother tongue.

Testing the apis needed by a modern Java developer.

How many times are you stuck at customer site because you don't remember the usage of a class or a method from a well known api?

Javadoc is sometimes complicated. Not easy to read. You want an example.

I have decided to document the classes that a modern developer has a great chance to meet at customer site.

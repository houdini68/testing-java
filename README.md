# Testing the Java ecosystem

Testing the APIs needed by a modern Java developer.

How many times are you in search of the usage of a class or a method of a well-known api?
Javadoc is sometimes complicated and not easy to read. You want an example.

I have decided to document the classes/APIs that a modern developer has a great chance to meet at customer site.

Each time I visit a site (Stackoverflow) to get some help on programming, or I made some investigations on a specific topic I will try to create a test that will be documented here.

It is an Apache Maven project, and it was developed using Intellij Idea.

On Intellij, as soon as you executed the tests, you can click on the icon 'Export Test Results...' and then export the results to HTML.
That will generate a nice HTML documenting the tests.  

Enjoy!

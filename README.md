# Testing Java,Spring framework,Guava,JPA(Hibernate),Mockito,AssertJ,...

Testing the apis needed by a modern Java developer.

How many times are you stuck at customer site because you don't remember the usage of a class or a method from a well known api?

Javadoc is sometimes complicated. Not easy to read. You want an example.

I have decided to document the classes that a modern developer has a great chance to meet at customer site.

Each time I visit a site (Stackoverflow) to get some help on programming or I made some investigations on a specific topic I will try to make a test that will be documented here.

Not yet documented:
Java 13, Spring framework (Spring Boot), JPA (Hibernate), Mockito, AssertJ,...

It is an Apache Maven project and it was written using Intellij Idea.

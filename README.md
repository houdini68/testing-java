# Testing the Java ecosystem

Testing the APIs needed by a modern Java developer.

How many times are you in search of the usage of a class or a method of a well-known api?
Javadoc is sometimes complicated and not easy to read. You want an example.

I have decided to document the classes/APIs that a modern developer has a great chance to meet at customer site.

Each time I visit a site (Stackoverflow) to get some help on programming, or I made some investigations on a specific topic I will try to create a test that will be documented here.

It is an Apache Maven project, and it was developed using Intellij Idea.
